Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Site contains 4 html pages which are accessible from any page to any other page.

Home (index.html) page contains my work experience in tabular form.
Blog (blog.html) has a list of references to sites that are currently followed by me.

Interest (interests.html) and About (about.html) has no information in them they are just created to show that we can access other pages from them.

All of the pages have a division that has my profile picture and hyperlinks to access other pages, this section will not be displayed on print media.
